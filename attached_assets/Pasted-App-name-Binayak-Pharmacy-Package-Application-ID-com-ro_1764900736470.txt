Summary

Binayak Pharmacy is a premium, professional Android app for streamlined pharmacy management. It combines modern, high-quality UI/UX with powerful AI automation to handle billing, inventory, alerts, reporting, security and offline/online operation. The app focuses on reliability, performance, and usability for a single-store owner.

Visual & Interaction System (Design Requirements)

Design a cohesive, modern, premium UI with layered motion and microinteractions:

Cards: elevated, flat, expandable variants, used for items, invoices, reports.

Backgrounds: images, gradients, blur, glassmorphism panels.

Shadows & elevation: multiple elevation levels to indicate hierarchy.

Transitions & page animations: smooth route transitions, shared element animations for item → detail flows.

Skeleton screens: content skeletons for slow loads (lists, cards, invoices).

Scroll behavior: momentum scrolling, infinite pagination, snapping where applicable (e.g., carousel, date pickers).

Tab bars & indicators: clear, accessible tab states and animated indicators.

Top app bar & bottom navigation: consistent hierarchy and affordances.

Side navigation drawer: hamburger (☰) at top-right to open side menu with deeper functions.

FAB (Floating Action Buttons): primary quick actions (add medicine, new bill).

Segmented controls & chips: for quick filters (category, expiry, brand).

Breadcrumbs, accordions, sliders, steppers & walkthroughs: for navigation and onboarding.

Quick action menus / speed dials: fast access to common tasks (scan barcode, add supplier).

Toasts, badges & notifications: contextual feedback, numeric badges for low stock/alerts.


All UI must follow accessibility (contrast, touch targets, font scales) and be optimized for performance.

Behavior & Logic (A → N)

Provide clear, implementable logic for the app. Each item below should be fully documented and implemented in code / wireflows.

A. Conditional logic (all if-else scenarios)

Examples: If stock ≤ threshold → create low-stock alert; if offline → queue actions for sync; if invoice created while offline and duplicate bill ID exists on sync → generate conflict resolution dialog.


B. Workflows

Purchase workflow: Create PO → Receive goods → Update inventory → Generate purchase invoice → Close PO.

Sales workflow: Add items (scan/manual) → apply discount/taxes → confirm payment → print/save invoice → update inventory & report.


C. How each feature works

Each screen/module should include input validation, DB transactions, fallbacks, and UI feedback. E.g., barcode scan: on-success locate SKU → show item card → add to cart; else show “not found” with add-new SKU quick action.


D. Logic-based behaviors & interactions

Autosave drafts for bills; undo for stock edits; debounce for search; optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure.


E. Navigation flow

Bottom navigation with 5 essential tabs (explicitly configured). Top-right hamburger (☰) opens side drawer with secondary features. Back button (←) consistent and predictable. Provide flow diagrams for primary flows (Billing → Payment → Receipt; Inventory → Item → Batch).


F. App rules

Single active cashier per device (configurable). All stock edits require supervisor approval if over threshold. Action audit trail always recorded.


G. Terms & Conditions

Built-in terms with versioning and mandatory acceptance on major updates; store acceptance timestamp and user ID.


H. Working mechanisms

Local database (SQLite / Room) as source-of-truth in offline mode; sync engine with cloud endpoint when online; conflict resolution policies.


I. Performance optimization

Lazy loading lists, pagination for large datasets, caching, database indexes, background sync, efficient image handling, compress and debounce operations, minimize re-renders.


J. Security & permission management

Data encryption at rest, secure local storage for credentials, biometric optional, role-based access control, permission prompts for camera (barcode), storage (backup), network. Secure API tokens and TLS for cloud sync.


K. Notifications & their systems

Local push for expiry and low stock; scheduled reminders; notification settings per event type; grouped notifications, in-app notification center.


L. Permission handling

Graceful fallbacks: if camera denied, provide manual barcode entry. Clear explanation modals when requesting sensitive permissions.


M. Error handling

Standardized error states: network, DB, permission, validation. Provide user-friendly messages + retry actions + logs for debugging. Telemetry for critical errors (opt-in).


N. How the app reacts to user actions

Immediate visual feedback (ripple, toast), optimistic updates, confirmations for destructive actions, undo options for recent changes.



---
